## Note 2

Your company's smart water bottle likely comprises several elements that can be protected through various types of intellectual property rights. Let's break it down:

1. **Patents**: If the smart water bottle incorporates innovative technology or a unique design process, you might want to consider applying for a patent. Patents protect inventions, including processes and unique functional aspects of a product. Remember, patents need to cover novel and non-obvious inventions. 

2. **Trademarks**: You should register a trademark for the brand name of your smart water bottle and possibly for its logo as well. Trademarks protect brand names, slogans, and logos used on goods and services.

3. **Industrial Design**: If your smart water bottle has a unique, non-functional design, you could register it as an industrial design. This protects the aesthetic aspects of a product.

4. **Copyright**: If there are any original written materials included with your product (like a user manual or unique software), these can be protected by copyright. Remember, copyright protects original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works.

Here are some steps you might want to follow to register these IP rights:

1. **Identify your IP**: Understand what types of IP you own and which of these you need to protect. For example, if there is a unique feature about the design or functionality of your smart water bottle, consider patenting it. 

2. **Search Existing IP**: Before applying, conduct a search to ensure your IP is unique. There are databases for this, such as the USPTO database for patents and trademarks in the US or the MyIPO database for Malaysia.

3. **Prepare and File Application**: Prepare the necessary documentation for your application. This usually includes a detailed description and diagrams or images of your IP. For example, a patent application needs to clearly explain the invention, how it works, and how it is unique from other existing technologies. 

4. **Fees**: There will be fees associated with each type of IP registration. Be sure to account for these in your budget. The fees vary depending on the type of IP and the country of registration. Remember, these fees do not include attorney fees should you decide to use one.

5. **Follow Up**: After submission, you'll have to follow up with the respective IP offices (like USPTO, WIPO, MyIPO, etc.) to check on your application status. It may take several months, or even years, before your IP is officially registered. 

Remember, the exact process and requirements may vary depending on the country where you wish to register your IP. It's also advisable to consult with an IP attorney or a specialist to help guide you through this process.

## Note 3

Based on the class notes you provided, here's the process to register your intellectual property for a newly invented and unique smart bottle:

1. **Identify the Type of Intellectual Property (IP)**: Based on the type of innovation, determine the appropriate type of IP protection. In this case, since you have invented a unique smart bottle, you'll likely need a patent/utility innovation to protect the technology involved. However, if the bottle has a unique design, you might also consider registering for an industrial design.

2. **Preparation**: You'll need to prepare all the necessary documentation that proves the originality of your invention and its usefulness. The documentation must be detailed enough to explain the invention's functionality, technology involved, and how it differs from the existing solutions or products.

3. **Application**: You'll need to fill out the appropriate application forms. These can be found at the MyIPO website. Depending on the type of IP, the appropriate form must be chosen. For a patent/utility innovation, you will need a patent filing form (https://www.myipo.gov.my/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SampleForm1.pdf).

4. **Fees**: Pay the required fees for the application. This can vary depending on the type of IP you are registering for, and also doesn't include any legal fees if you are working with a lawyer. You can find a rough estimation of the fees at https://www.myipo.gov.my/en/part-i-patent-form-fees/.

5. **Submit Application**: Once your application is ready and the fees have been paid, submit your application to MyIPO.

6. **Review and Verification**: MyIPO will review your application, verify the originality of your invention, and if everything checks out, they will grant your patent.

7. **Receive Certification**: Based on the client charter, you should expect to receive a Certificate of Filing 3 days from the date of receipt of the online application. If all goes well, you'll receive a Certificate of Grant of Patent 4 months 3 weeks from the date of filing if you request for Expedited Examination and only applies to complete applications without any objections. If you're filing a normal application, you can expect the certificate of grant around 26 months from the date of filing.

Remember, this patent will typically be valid for 20 years from the date of application, and it provides you the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing your invention.

Please consult a legal professional or intellectual property expert to ensure that all steps are correctly followed according to your local jurisdiction.

## Note 1

Based on the provided class notes, here are the steps to make an organizational plan for your business:

1. **Introduction to the Organisation:** Start by stating the vision, mission, and objectives of your business organization. Your vision will help to prepare your business for the future and achieve what it aspires to be.

Use the SMART concept for setting your objectives. Also, consider including your business's logo and motto if applicable.

2. **Develop an Organisation Chart:** Based on the structure of your business, develop an organisation chart that best suits your organization.

Consider the structure based on shifts, number of workers, functions, products, regions, and clients.

3. **Prepare a List of Administration Personnel:** List all the personnel involved in the administration section of the business and those personnel who are not directly involved in operation (i.e., indirect workers). Use a two-column table to indicate the personnel position in one column and the number of personnel in the second column.

4. **Develop a Schedule of Tasks and Responsibilities:** For each personnel position, explain its main tasks and responsibilities. You can illustrate this by drawing a two-column table where you depict all the positions in one column and explain the tasks and responsibilities of each position in the other.

5. **Develop a Schedule of Remuneration:** Detail how much remuneration is allocated for the administrative staff.

6. **Determine the Office Equipment and Supplies:** List all the office furniture and equipment that are necessary for the administration section.

7. **Prepare an Administration Budget:** The final step is preparing the budget for the administration section. This will take into account all the costs associated with salaries, equipment, supplies, and any other costs associated with running the administrative side of your business.

Remember, while making an organizational plan, it's also important to consider factors like whether staff needs training, the cost of training, and how long training will take. This should be part of your administrative budget.

To make a financial plan for a business, you need to follow several steps, as outlined in the class notes provided.

The financial requirements for each of these plans are typically presented in the form of operating budgets. Also, sales forecasts derived from the marketing plan are crucial inputs for the financial plan.
